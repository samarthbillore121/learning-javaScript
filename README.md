This project was created a part of my personal learning for JavaScript language. 

This emphasis on learning few of the important concepts of JavaScripts : 
1. How is the DOM manipulated.
2. What is deboucing, how is applied.
3. How is the low level design structured to enable scaling up of project without any issue.
4. How is UI supported for various resolutions. 

This uses, basic HTML, Css and JavaScript to design a Small Application of TO-DO list components which are useful for our day-to-day tasks. 

LLD : 

1. index.html file : HTML file, which defines the UI of the whole application.
2. styles.css file : Defines all the css in one big file. ( Not very good for scaling, but get the job done for small projects )
3. Modular code is mostly JS. Names are self explanatory.
